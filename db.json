will be blooming with fresh flowers!\n\nThis was announced by the National Parks Board (NParks) on Wednesday (20 Feb), as they also revealed that the theme for the show will be “Flowers in Bloom”.\n\nThe event, which will be held at Gardens by the Bay, is open to both locals and tourists, and is expected to draw in around 400,000 visitors.\n\nAccording to NParks, the flower show will be a celebration of all things floral, with gardening demonstrations, horticultural exhibits, and competitions for both professionals and amateurs. There will also be opportunities for visitors to purchase plants and garden accessories.\n\nIn addition to the Singapore Flower Show, there are other events lined up for next year that will celebrate flora and fauna. These include the launch of a new nature reserve in Marsiling and a free visit day to the zoo for residents living in the Central Catchment Area.\n\n#  Fresh flower orders to be available online in Singapore in 2022!\n\n![reservation-bg.jpg](/images/reservation-bg.jpg)\n\nAs lifestyles in Singapore become busier, people have been looking for convenient options to purchase fresh flowers. In response to this, nyflowersbylagi.com has announced that it will be launching an online flower ordering platform in 2022!\n\nThe online flower ordering platform will allow customers to conveniently browse and order fresh flowers from the comfort of their homes. In addition to providing a wide variety of fresh flowers, the platform will also offer exclusive discounts and privileges to its members.\n\nWith this new platform, nyflowersbylagi.com hopes to further penetrate the Singapore market and provide customers with an easy and convenient way to purchase fresh flowers!\n\n#  Singapore to have world's freshest flowers in 2022!\n\nIn a move to make Singapore the global leader for fresh flowers, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) announced plans to have the world's freshest flowers in 2022.\n\nThis was in line with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's announcement during the National Day Rally last year that Singapore will become a global city for flowers.\n\nThe AVA plans to achieve this through the following initiatives:\n\n- Setting up of a high-tech flower auction centre which will enable Singapore to better compete for flower imports against regional hubs such as Dubai and Amsterdam;\n\n- Establishment of an international floriculture research centre which will develop new flower varieties and cultivation techniques specifically suited for tropical climates; and\n\n- Coordination of an annual international floriculture show in Singapore to promote the country as a premier destination for floral lovers from near and far.\n\n#  Flower delivery in Singapore to get a makeover in 2022!\n\nSingapore is one of the most popular countries in the world for flower delivery. According to a study by the market research firm IBISWorld, the industry is expected to grow an annualized 2.6% over the next five years, reaching revenues of $1.2 billion in 2022.\n\nHowever, given the competitive landscape and shifting consumer preferences, the industry is set to experience a makeover in 2022. Here are three key trends that will shape flower delivery in Singapore over the next five years:\n\n1) Rise of online flower delivery services\n\nOnline flower delivery is projected to be the fastest-growing segment of the sector over the next five years. Driven by convenience and affordability, more consumers are opting for online floral arrangements over traditional bouquets.\n\nIn response, brick-and-mortar florists are starting to offer their own online delivery services, while online-only players are expanding into physical stores. This is resulting in a more fragmented marketplace, with consumers having more choices when it comes to floral arrangements and delivery methods.\n\n2) Increased demand for affordable flowers\n\nWith rising inflation rates and concerns about economic stability, consumers are becoming increasingly price-sensitive when it comes to buying flowers. As a result, there is increasing demand for affordable floral arrangements, especially among younger buyers.\n\nThis has led florists to focus on offering lower-priced options, such as bundled flower arrangements and simple bouquets. They are also starting to source flowers from other countries where they are cheaper (e.g. Indonesia and Thailand), in order to keep costs down.\n\n3) Shift towards sustainable flowers\n\nSustainability has become a key concern for many consumers, especially millennials. In response, florists are starting to offer more sustainable floral options, such as organic flowers and recycled materials.\n\n#  Get your fresh flowers for your special occasions only from Singapore in 2022!\n\nWhen you need to order flowers for a special occasion, it's important to make sure that you're getting the best possible product. That's why you should only turn to Singapore florists in 2022 for your needs!\n\nOur florists have years of experience in creating beautiful arrangements, and we can guarantee that you won't be disappointed with the results.
